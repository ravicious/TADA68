# TADA68

## Customizing the setup

Each of [the releases](https://github.com/ravicious/TADA68/releases) has a link in the description which points to the given config in the firmware editor. You can then make changes and saved them and create a custom link like that as well – I believe it's done by clicking on the floppy disk icon.

Even if you choose the English translation, not all elements of the UI are going to be translated. This post explains the options for the Fn button.
